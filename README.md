# tic-tac-toe

Python code for the game tic-tac-toe. There are two players, A and B. When prompted, each player enters a move ("<position1> <position2>") on the board. 

The positions are 0-indexed and there are a maximum of 9 moves. The user can end the game early by typing "done" in the command line.

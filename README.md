# tic-tac-toe

Python code for the game tic-tac-toe. There are two players, A and B. When prompted, each player enters a move ("x-coordinate y-coordinate" where (0, 0) is the bottom-left corner) in the command line to place a symbol ("X" for player A and "O" for player B) at that coordinate position on the tic-tac-toe board. 

The positions are 0-indexed, and there is a maximum limit of 9 moves.

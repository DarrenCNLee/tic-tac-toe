# tic-tac-toe

Python code for the game tic-tac-toe. There are two players, A and B. When prompted, each player enters a move ("position1 position2") in the command line to put a symbol ("X" for player A and "O" for player B) at that position on the board. 

The positions are 0-indexed, and there are a maximum of 9 moves. The user can end the game early by typing "done" in the command line.
